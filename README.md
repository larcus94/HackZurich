#### a simple yet powerful tool to create semantic time-feed networks

Time is money and while money may be abundant, time will always be a limited commodity.

Calendars and schedules are part of everyone's lives. Managing them, however, remains a challenge, even for the administratively skilled.

We believe a calendar should be simple and semantic, read like a book: top to bottom, left to right. Enter caltag; a simple tool that allows you to merge and filter event-feeds:

* Start by merging related feeds into one.
* Boil the merged feed down to only what truly matters to you by applying syntactical filters.
* Share that feed with whom you want so others can aggregate it in the same way, applying their own rules.
* Recursively filter feeds to create meaningful, share-able information channels.
* Scale to greater network models like pub-sub.
* Dramatically increase the signal-to-noise ratio of your favorite time-management software.
* Make scheduling data usable.

Turn your traditional shared calendar into a meaningful data feed for yourself or whomever you want. Stay up-to-date with your interests and filter out the fuzz.

/*
 'XbICalendarIcsTest' assists in loading a .ics file and testing its components.
 Subclass this class and provide the icsFileNameUnderTest method to test a file.
 
 The idea is NOT to test every component in each .ics file.  Rather, we are trying
 to get a good sampling of each file and then test any aspect which makes that
 file unique.  Along the same lines, we take care not to (over-)test the basic 
 parsing of components because, really, that's libical itself.  Therefore, the 
 primary value in these unit (/integration) tests is found in testing that our 
 XbIC* objects allow for accessing the parsed values.
